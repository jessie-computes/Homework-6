## Installation 
There is no installation, but anyone can visit the deployed site at this [link]( https://jessie-computes.github.io/Homework-6/.). 
## Usage 
This application can be used to check the current weather and predicted weather for any city.
## Issues
Originally, I intended for the dynamically generated buttons to have a functionality that allowed for searches for cities when the buttons were clicked, but I was unable to add that to dynamically generated buttons.
